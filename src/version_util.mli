(** This module gives access to the same version/build information returned by
    [Command]-based executables when called with the [-version] or [-build-info] flags
    by [$0 version (-build-info | -version)] or [$0 (-build-info | -version)].
    Here's how it works: we arrange for the build system to, at link time, include an
    object file that defines symbols that version_util.ml uses to get the strings that
    contain the information that this module provides.  When building with OMake, our
    OMakeroot runs build_info.sh to generate *.build_info.c with the symbols and that is
    linked in.

    Currently this module is not included in the public release.

      One calls [putenv t] in a program before calling OMake to set the appropriate
      environment variable so that the application-specific fields in the program being
      compiled will have value [t].   That is, one calls [putenv] in the program building
      the application and [Version_util.application_specific_fields] in the application
