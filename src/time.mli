(** {5 values} *)

(** Unlike [Time_ns], this module purposely omits [max_value] and [min_value]:
    1. They produce unintuitive corner cases because most people's mental models of time
    do not include +/- infinity as concrete values
    2. In practice, when people ask for these values, it is for questionable uses, e.g.,
    as null values to use in place of explicit options. *)

(** [add t s] adds the span [s] to time [t] and returns the resulting time.

    NOTE: adding spans as a means of adding days is not accurate, and may run into trouble
    due to shifts in daylight savings time, float arithmetic issues, and leap seconds.
    See the comment at the top of Zone.mli for a more complete discussion of some of
    the issues of time-keeping.  For spans that cross date boundaries, use date functions
    instead.

val to_date       : t -> zone:Zone.t -> Date0.t

(** Because timezone offsets change throughout the year (clocks go forward or back) some
    local times can occur twice or not at all.  In the case that they occur twice, this
    function gives [`Twice] with both occurrences in order; if they do not occur at all,
    this function gives [`Never] with the time at which the local clock skips over the
    desired time of day.

    Note that this is really only intended to work with DST transitions and not unusual or
    dramatic changes, like the calendar change in 1752 (run "cal 9 1752" in a shell to
    see).  In particular it makes the assumption that midnight of each day is unambiguous.

    Most callers should use {!of_date_ofday} rather than this function.  In the [`Twice]
    and [`Never] cases, {!of_date_ofday} will return reasonable times for most uses. *)

(** [of_localized_string ~zone str] read in the given string assuming that it represents
    a time in zone and return the appropriate Time.t *)
val of_localized_string : zone:Zone.t -> string -> t

(** [to_string_abs ~zone t] returns a string that represents an absolute time, rather than
    a local time with an assumed time zone.  This string can be round-tripped, even on a
    machine in a different time zone than the machine that wrote the string.

    The string will display the date and of-day of [zone] together with [zone] as an
    offset from UTC.

    [to_string_abs_trimmed] is the same as [to_string_abs], but drops trailing seconds and
    milliseconds if they are 0.

    Note that the difference between [to_string] and [to_string_abs] is not that one
    returns an absolute time and one doesn't, but that [to_string_abs] lets you specify
    the time zone, while [to_string] takes it to be the local time zone.

(** [pause_forever] sleeps indefinitely. *)

(** [occurrence side time ~ofday ~zone] returns a [Time.t] that is the occurrence of ofday
    (in the given [zone]) that is the latest occurrence (<=) [time] or the earliest
    occurrence (>=) [time], according to [side].

    NOTE: If the given time converted to wall clock time in the given zone is equal to
    ofday then the t returned will be equal to the t given.

   Supplying [~can_equal_after:true] allows the result to satisfy [time >= after].
